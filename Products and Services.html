                 During Lockdown people lost their jobs.<br>
                    In the townships life was very difficult because a lot of bread-winners lost their jobs and could no longer provide for their families.<br>
                    which is why the issue of looting was more advanced in KZN, we came with this idea to give out food parcels to try and reduce the issue of Looting.<br>
                    People started committing crime in order to put food on the table for their families, you  cannot really blame them beacause it was hunger that made them coomit those crimes.<br>
                    We started dishing out hot porradge for breakfast in one of the community halls and we saw that it was helping the people of the community and decided to also add supper on the menu.<br>
                    we ended up getting a few donations and sponsers so we were able to give out food parcels each and every month to try and reduce the issue of starvation<br>
                 Globally, in times of crisis, gender-based violence tends to escalate, placing increased demand on services for survivors .
                <br>
                    Disaster is by its very nature discruptive, but the needs of survivors of gender-based violence remain the same.
                    <br>
                    We started this programme for the homeless because there are some people who take advantage of cetain situations. The shelter has been running for almost 6 years now and still counting.
                    <br>In 2020 when the National State of disaster was declared the country entered a strict lockdown, Women in violent relationships were locked in their homes with the most common perpetrator of domestic violence in south africa, Which made us to open a new counselling facillity in one of our shelter homes.
